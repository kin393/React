# React

Just a place to put all my React code :)

Props Drilling -> Passing props from one component to another and to grandchild -> avoid
To manage large data use Redux/NGRX
There are cons -> Complex to setup/ Too much boiler plate
To modify the redux store we dispatch an action which in turn calls the reducer and that updates the store
